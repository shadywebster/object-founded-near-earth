This project focuses on training and evaluating machine learning models for classifying Near-Earth Objects as hazardous or non-hazardous using the near earth objects.csv dataset. We explored Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. The XGBoost model demonstrated the best overall performance with balanced precision and recall. Visualizations highlight the distribution of objects and model predictions in the feature space.
